Inter network is a group of devices that r group together and communicate with each other across one single network
or may interconnected networks, Ex - Internet

Large corporate networks r broken into smaller networks called LAN(Local Area Network) and all these LANs r together
considered as WAN(Wide Area Network)
MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)

LAN is basically a small group of devices, such if u have more then one location in chicago each of those locations
would be considered as the LAN and generally the devices in a LAN are located geographically close to each other to
share data, Files and other information, Screenshot(15)
In WAN the LANs the brought together by 3rd party such as telcom providers which provide connectivity to each of
these different sites, In a LAN a device will connect to printers within that LAN instead of printing all the way
across town or the country they will however possibly share files and communicate across the WAN
In order to connect a group of LANs together and create a WAN each facility would require a connection whether using
T1,T3,ATM,Frame Relay etc to communicate with each other, Screenshot(16)

OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) Model it is theoritical model that will relate that how the data has to transfer
from one endpoint to another, The traffic moves from layer 7(Application Layer) and then moves to layer 1(Physical
layer) and cross the medium and go to the OSI stack of the destination so then going from layer 1 to the layer 7,
Each layer has independent task in this process and specific protocols, Screenshot(17)
Layer 7 to layer 5 r know as the upper layers and they r usually generated from the softwares attempting to
communicate over the network, the lower layers from layer 4 to layer 1 handles the actual data transport across the
network, the layer 1 is responsible for placing the information on the physical medium and sending it off to the
other endpoint
Layer 7(Application layer) -> This is were applications such as email(SMTP) or FTP are provided, this layer is
closet to the end user and begins the process that would started due to an application requesting network services
Layer 6(Presentation layer) -> It prepares the data and makes it readable for the network in order to be transfered,
as the coding and conversion makes it readable from one system to another or applications on next layer,
Some of the data formats negotiated at this layer could include ASCII, Binary and JPEG encryption
Layer 5(Session layer) -> It establishes, manages and terminates the communication sessions, we use protocols here
such as NetBIOS, RPC(Remote Processure Call)
Layer 4 do this from the Google Networking Tutorial

Port Numbers defines which application the payload is intended for , Port no's ranges from 0 to 65535
Ports form 0 to 1023 r known as designated ports or well known ports, such as TCP is for Port 80 as it designated
from web traffic while TCP port 22 is designated for SSH, ports also ensure flow control and air free transport
As the traffic rates increase the TCP ports will buffer to ensure that their is no data loss
TCP , UDP and Handshakes from the Google Networking Tutorial

Layer 3(Network layer) -> IP is the protocol used at this layer , this layer defines the network addresses and a
logical network layout and router r required at this layer to communicate between network subnets

Layer 2(Data link layer) ->  This layer is seperated into 2 sub layers -> LLC(Logical link control) it manages the
communications between devices and these r functions r required for establishment and control of logical links
between devices
the 2nd sub layer is the MAC(Media Access Control) -> It manages the communication between the logical and physical
mediums and this defines the MAC addresses

Layer 1 do this from the Google Networking Tutorial

TCP/IP is the most popular set of communications protocols used in a day, the TCP/IP consists of two layer 4 and 3
TCP is for Transport layer which focus on the error free flow control, it buffers the stream of data to prevent the
overloading and the IP part is for the Network layer which focuses on the Addressing, routing and fragmentation of
data

TCP vs UDP -> Screenshot(18)

A broadcast domain is the logical separation of networked devices that can be reached via unicast or broadcast msg
on the data link layer means its the device that hears all of the traffic that has been broadcast across the network
while attempting to reach all users on a particular network segment, now in bigger LANs it can result into issue
due to mulitple devices attempting to process these requests as the amount of traffic could be really huge while
a Collision domain is a division within Broadcast Domain in which Frames from one networked device could collide
with another, Screenshot(19)
In the Collision domain any one device NIC could send out a frame which could then result in a collision with the
another one, All of the devices among the collision domain share the bandwidth

Their r 3 different types of traffics ->
- Unicast - this traffic is sent from one to one host
- Multicast - this traffic is sent from one to many host
- Broadcast - this traffic is sent from one to all host
Screenshot(20)

Their r numerous devices available that will transmit and receive the network traffic these devices includes hubs,
switches and routers
Hub -> It has one broadcast domain and one collision domain share bandwidth, bcz which it cannot differentiate
where it sends the data, as the data received is sent out to all ports to all devices and this can down bandwidth
and initiate collisions on a large scale, On the Hub a broadcast can be heared by everyone and everyone is in danger
of collisions, in some instances the users will daisy chain one hub off another creating even larger broadcast
domain making the collision domain even more dangerous and now the bandwidth availabilty also took a major hit in
a hub, data which is sent out on a port is received on all ports

Bridge -> It is also not used any longer , A bridge was a able to divide a collision domain while still maintaining
a single broadcast domain means it has one broadcast domain and segments the collision domain
MAC was examined at the bridge edge to decide where to forward data, hence bridge create a table to mapping the
physical addresses in particular ports, traffic can also be queued in bridge untill the collision domain is clear

Switch -> In it each port has its own individual collision domain and by default the entire switch make a broadcast
domain means one broadcast domain and multiple collision domain, it examines source MAC to know where to send and will
broadcast is it is necessary means when the user send out a packet to an unknown destination for the 1st time the
packets will be flooded out all the ports except the source port and once the destination is found it is kept in the
MAC address table and for future that source port will know excatly where to send the information and then only the
source and the destination ports will be affected

Physical Ports to MAC address mapping is kept in a table called ARP table and both the router and the host have this
information and this ensures that the both devices knows where the information is going to be sent to and the device
does not know the physical address to send this data to it will sent out an ARP request and then wait for the ARP
reply for this information
To get the update to date information in case the physical address changes on the port, the default time in switch is
5 minutes and in switch the ports r able to use full duplex which means sending and reciveing traffic simultanously
,Switch can process data is far more then bridge

Router -> It physically segment the broadcast domain means it has multiple broadcast domains, traffic can not be
forwarded from a router unless it knows to do so means it will not send the traffic from one LAN segment to another,
If their is no router multiple LANs would be cut off of each other and they will not send traffic from one to another

Network Media Types ->
Twisted Cables -> Do this from the Google Networking Tutorial

To connect these cables using Pin layouts->
- Straight-Through cables -> These r used from host to switch or Router to switch, The wires from end to end r
one to one , two to two , three to three , six to six bcz of which they r known r straight through, Screenshot(21)

- Crossover Cable -> they r used to connect host to host or switch to switch, these wires r connected as one to three
, two to six , three to one , six to two, these pin layouts r switched bcz their host devices and switchs use the
same pair of wire to transmit and recieve, so if communications were attempted using a striaght-through cable between
switches they would be trying to transmit and recieve on the same lots so we reverse them in order to properly pass
through communications, Screenshot(22)

- Coaxical cables -> they r less common, the distances in devices is vastly greater then the ethernet cable, but the
accessiories needed to install them r tidious and difficult to install on large network

Wireless communication is flexible and cheap as it uses the Radio Frequencies or infrared waves to transmit data,
access points r used to transmit and recieve the wireless signals, access points r placed all through out the
facility depending on the coverage needed, these access points r connected back into the LAN via wired connection
into a switch, so this access point can be autonomous in nature or managed via wireless controllers, wireless
adapters r used at the network endpoints that require a wireless signal

Ethernet Frame -> Do this from the Google Networking Tutorial

Types of Ethernet -> Screenshot(23)

CAM(Content Addressable Memory) Table -> A CAM table is used in a Switch to remember where particular MAC addresses
r located on attached ports, when a switch receives a frame for the 1st time it does not know where to send it so
it floods to all ports except the one from where it came from, once it finds the port to which it needs to go to
then it keeps the information in the CAM table for future reference for specific amount of time, and in this way
all the future decisions r made with the unicast packets instead of flooding the switch with all broadcast packets
Screenshot(24,25)

Their r two types of switching Packet and Circuit Switching
Packet Switching -> The data is divided into packets and transmitted individually, Packets r the data which r
encapsulated at the Network layer and they contain logical IP address information that is used to route the packets
through networks, Frames r the data that r encapsulated at the data link layer which contains the physical MAC
address information that can be used to switch frame through networks, frames r encapsulated inside packets and
these do not need to follow each other and they can travel different routes to the destination, in some cases
the network load will make row and these packets can then be queued and buffered to wait to be transmitted to the
destination, when all packets reach the destination, the packets r reconstructed to original msg

Circuit Switching -> A dedicated line is opened for each transmission, tis channel remains open for transmission
even if their is no traffic preceiding over, each of these can be compared to different types of traffic for ex
a packet switch network could be perfect for data network for circuit switch network  the phone system can be used

Circuit switch is often considered more reliable bcz information will always flow due to line being dedicated and
open however packet switching has depend on protocols such as TCP to make data more reliable, even voices now on
packet switching networks with the help of UDP and particular QoS policies as it guarentees voice traffic
receives presedence over other traffic

V-LANs is the way to logically segment networks into seperate broadcast domains, In the V-LANs the administratively
defined set of switchports that will be associated to a VLAN which creates its own broadcast domain, a physical
switch has a giant broadcast domain and when a VLAN is created on a switch a broadcast domain is segmented without
needing a router
Now a Router or layer 3 switch is needed to communicate between VLNs, communcations between different broadcast
domains must occur at Network layer which is why a router or layer 3 switch is required, this device will then
route the traffic from one broadcast domain to another or from one subnet to another
VLANs r created to futher segment the traffic this limits broadcast which can cause large amounts of overhead if
the broadcast domains r too large, this helps to limit the no. of broadcasts and this is also very beneficial for
security purposes as u can create VLAN for individuals in one department or based on the floors in the building
and they will all serve the purpose of segmenting the broadcast traffic from people or devices, Suppose u have a
Marketing department then u can keep all files, printers and users within marketing and not share any other information
and other VLAN for the IT department, U can also create a hybrid VLAN in which users r in multiple department,
VLANs provide u the ability to manupulate ur network design as u see fit and this should be done by keeping the
growth and scalability in mind as ur network design can both grown and scalable for future situations and it is
difficult to modify the deeply routed VLANs and hosts within those VLANs once they r built

To configure VLANs steps ->
- Create the VLAN itself, VLAN no must be 1 through 1005, VLAN between 1006 to 4000 and so on r available but u
must be in VTP transparent mode in order to create those VLAN no's, give the VLAN a unique name for identification
purposes, they can be named on the basis of department or floor
- Associate the VLAN to a particular Port

Here we r creating a VLAN 20 in configuration mode and name the VLAN ccna and then we enter in to the configuration
mode on the router and assigned the VLAN to port fa0/1 by using the cmd 'switchport access vlan 20' and then we
have associate the VLAN 20 to port 1 and this can also be done to other ports as well which would put those ports
into the same broadcast domain as port 1

code ->
Switch#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#vlan 20
Switch(config-vlan)#name CCNA
Switch(config-vlan)#exit
Switch(config)#int fa0/1
Switch(config-if)#switchport access vlan 20
Switch(config-if)#exit
Switch(config)#exit
Switch#sh vlan
%SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console

cmd ->
Switch#sh run int fa0/1

VTP(VLAN Trunking Protocol) -> This advertise it's VLAN configuration information to neighbouring switches, this
ability enables all switches in the network to learn the VLAN information dynamically as oppose to u going and
statically configuring it on each switch and from the management point of view it is very beneficial
Configuring VTP on all the switches and then gain the VLANs on one switch can save quite a bit of time

Their r 3 modes to configure in a switch for VTP -> server, client and transparent
cmd -> SW1(config)#vtp mode server
Server mode -> Originates VTP advertisements a switch must be in server mode to create, modify and delete VLANs and
have that information propigated across the network
Client mode -> It is same as the server however it cannot create, modify or delete VLANs , it will listen to the
server and make the changes necessary for VLAN configuration
Transparent mode -> It ignores the VTP advertisements and simpily forwards them on, this is important as it will not
affect the VLAN database which has all VLAN information for that particular switch and they will not receive information
that VTP domain knows about and it stands alone in its configuration, transparent mode will not affect any other
switches VLAN database information, transparent mode can create its own VLAN however it will not be propigated
anywhere

Other important VTP settings , VTP domains, VTP passwords and VTP configuration revision
VTP Domain is the name of the entire and its members now the group of switchs which r involved in a particular singualr
process is the VTP domain
VTP use a password to allow memberships, to ensure that an unauthorized switch is not put into domain that could
temper with the VLAN database and introduce the high configuration revision
VTP configuration revision is another important aspect of the VTP it tells that the group of switches which device
has the latest VLAN database information, now the switch with the highest configuration revision in the VTP server
mode will invoke its authority as having the latest main VLAN database information

Before the update process can begin the VTP domain must match between devices, show VTP status can provide u with
this information for each switch once VTP domains match on the switches then the update process begins whether or
whenever server switch add, delete or updates the configuration for the VLAN, when the update occurs configuration
revision counter updates by 1 to make to ensure that all switches have the same revision no. which can ensure that
the device r upto data on VLAN information

When U add a new switch to the environment u must check the VTP information bcz if the switch is configured with the
same name as ur VTP domain and it's a server it can send all of its VLAN configuration to all of ur switches now
if it's configuration revision counter is higher then the switches in the network the the VLAN configuration will
be sent out
All VTP updates will be sent out on active trunk uplinks whether that's 8021q or ISL, U need to ensure that a password
is sent that it matches across switches if not this will prevent switches from VTP domain

EX ->
Switch(config)#vtp mode server   //Setting device to VTP SERVER mode.
Switch(config)#vtp domain CCNA   //Changing VTP domain name from NULL to CCNA

cmd -> Switch#sh vtp status // this will provide the information regarding the VTP version which must match on
switches in the network, it will show u the revision and addition vtp attributes
